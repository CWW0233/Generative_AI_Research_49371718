## 🚀 Usage

This repository is primarily for organizing research files.  
Future collaborators should:
1. Navigate by folders to locate relevant resources.  
2. Keep filenames clear to reflect versioning (avoid too many "final" versions).  
3. Use pull requests for major changes to ensure version control.

## 📝 Notes

- Some folders are placeholders and need cleanup (e.g., `new folder/`, `新增資料夾/`).  
- Consider adding version control best practices (e.g., use Git for tracking changes in documents).  
- `.DS_Store` should be added to `.gitignore` to avoid clutter.
